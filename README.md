# Fun With Science

Are you bored solving the questions using the tough physics formulas?? ðŸ˜©
Are you bored of long calculations?? ðŸ˜©
Then here is a solution to your problems. ðŸ˜ƒ
This project is a Physics calculator where the user just needs to enter the values and the project calculates the result using the formula.

It really is that easy!

And the best part of it? **FunwithScience is open source!** ðŸ¤©

**The website is live and can be visited on https://technscience.com/**
